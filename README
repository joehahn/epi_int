V7.0 of epi_int, which is my N-body integrator designed to simulate self-gravitating
planetary rings. For details, see my 2013 paper on this code, which is presently in
review at Astrophysical Journal.

To execute, start IDL and execute @epi_int.pro. To configure your simulation, edit the
input parameters in inputs.pro. The code is heavily commented, consult them for
further guidance. Execute @results.pro to view the output.
