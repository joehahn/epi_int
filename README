V7.0 of epi_int, which is my N-body integrator designed to 
simulate self-gravitating planetary rings. For details, see 
my 2013 ApJ paper on this code, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...772..122H

To execute, start IDL and execute @epi_int.pro. To configure 
your simulation, edit the input parameters in inputs.pro. 
The code is heavily commented, consult the code for further 
guidance. Execute @results.pro to view the output.

Developed with v6.4 of IDL, but this code is known to work with IDL v8.3
