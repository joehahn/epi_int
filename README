V7.0 of epi_int, which is my N-body integrator designed to 
simulate self-gravitating planetary rings. For details, see 
my 2013 ApJ paper on this code, http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...772..122H

To execute, start IDL and enter @epi_int.pro at the prompt. To configure 
your simulation, edit the input parameters in inputs.pro; presently this
file is configured to simulate the response of the outer edge of
Saturn's B ring to satellite Mimas' m=2 inner Lindblad resonance there,
and that simulation executes in 15 minutes on my circa 2008 PC.
The code is heavily commented, consult the code for further 
guidance. Execute @results.pro to view the output.

Developed with v6.4 of IDL, but this code is known to work with IDL v8.3
